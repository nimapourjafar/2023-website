        Growing up in Scarbs, I caught bare different words, accents, and vibes
        from mans around me. Felt the education getting a big up, ahile
      </p>
      <p>Or a more proper translation ....</p>
      <p>
        Toronto man slang is something pretty dear to my heart. Growing up with
        family in Scarborough — I picked up a lot of different words, accents,
        and tones that you would pick up learning any other language
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        As I&#39;ve been talking to more people from different places and
        learning about how families, cultures, and communities work around the
        world, I&#39;ve noticed something that interests me: language.
      </p>
      <p>
        People will have their own personal way of describing experiences others
        put a different name to, like playground games, food, and even slang
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I&#39;ve found myself having to explain some vocabulary I
        casually toss-up in conversation because of how embedded Toronto slang
        is in my lingo. But, I&#39;ve found it very hard to explain the origins
        of this lingo and the connections between the words I say and what they
        mean
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn&#39;t until I learnt Toronto Slang had a deep anthropological —
        that goes back and ties into not only the city of Toronto but the
        cultures of the myriad of ethnic groups that run our city.
      </p>
      <p>
        This article is not only a deep dive into the history, but I will also
        attach a handy guide at the end for those who want to become fluent in
        Toronto Man
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I feel like I need to clarify something — the Toronto accent isn&#39;t
        just something that is chanted at Raptors games, Eaton Centre, and the
        CN Tower. It leaks throughout the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) — which
        includes the likes of major cities like Toronto and even suburbs
      </p>
      <p>
        Regardless, the Toronto accent first materialized from the widespread
        immigration from Caribbean, East African, and Middle Eastern groups
      </p>
      <p>
        This was happening in the 1960s — primarily because immigration policies
        had eased for non-white individuals, with one of the biggest groups
        being Jamaicans
      </p>
      <p>
        Here we see one of the first and closest connections to Toronto Slang —
        Patois. Patois acted as a language that was easy for Jamaicans to use
        during times of slavery and colonization, where colonists would force
        them to communicate in English
      </p>
      <p>
        Words like &quot;mandem&quot;, &quot;mans&quot;, &quot;ting&quot;,
        &quot;wah gwan&quot;, and so many more were Patois words that made their
        way into the daily dialogue
      </p>
      <p>
        From here, it becomes hard to identify where the slang develops. What
        can be said is that the ethnic groups, I previously mentioned, were all
        grouped in low-income communities. This caused a unique linguistic
        fusion as people from diverse backgrounds interacted and shared their
        respective terminologies. The result was an amalgamation of accents,
        words, and vibes that collectively formed what is now known as Toronto
        slang
      </p>
      <p>
        Arabic terms that are rooted in Muslim culture are now commonly tossed
        around by the Toronto man. &quot;Wallahi&quot; is a term used by Muslims
        to emphasize the truthfulness of a statement — much like &quot;I swear
        to god.&quot; In Islamic cultures, uttering this expression is a very
        serious expression of sincerity. Now, the term has been borrowed by all
        ethnic groups and normalized within the span of Toronto slang. Similar
        terms are &quot;Inshallah&quot; and &quot;Akhi&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward to today, and the Toronto accent is now a mainstream
        phenomenon. Although there is a rich history behind the accent, and it
        is rooted in deep multiculturalism — the Toronto accent has now become
        synonymous with pop culture. Social media pages like 6ixbuzz, rappers
        like Drake, and the numerous debates and misconceptions over it being
        &quot;fake&quot; have made Toronto Slang an integral part of young
        generations
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my favourite influencers that takes advantage of the Toronto
        accent is
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RandomOrderStudios"
          >Random Order Studios</a
        >
        — they&#39;re one of my top YouTube channels
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the Toronto accent to a lot of outsiders is something
        off-putting or something they may find funny about the city. People will
        call it pigeon-english or make fun of how it sounds. Some people have
        even called me out on &quot;my accent sounding like a Toronto man&quot;
        although I like to think I speak proper English
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it all has to do with context. I&#39;m taking a Chinese class
        right now and what&#39;s unique about the language is how each word has
        its own distinct character
      </p>
      <p>
        When my amazing 老师 explains the oracle bone script and how a character
        visually represents what it means — my intuition shifts
      </p>
      <p>But different types of people have different intuition</p>
      <p>
        I know 口 has to do with openings, how it&#39;s used as a radical, and the
        history behind it. But others may simply think it means box. Maybe even
        say &quot;How am I supposed to guess that?&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, you aren&#39;t! That&#39;s the beauty. History and anthropology
        aren&#39;t things we derive ourselves or can guess. They&#39;re new
        paradigms to our intuition that help us think how we think
