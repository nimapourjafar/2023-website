          I interviewed and got close to a lot of opportunities, but just missed
          — Contrary VP, Cansbridge Scholarship, Figma/Google SWE. The feedback
          I got from a lot of these is that I&#39;m too young/early and need to
          find more footings/experiences on-campus — still thinking about this
        </li>

          I did not do a lot of interesting work this term. My time was split
          between adjusting to living on my own and school. Next term, school
          will become my 2nd priority before projects and going deep into
          things

      <p>
        I just wrapped up my first semester of college studying computer science
        @ The University of Waterloo
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a change of pace from the routines I had set myself up for since
        May. Life was mostly just waking up, skipping school (at this point I
        had already my acceptances or had graduated), heading downtown to work
        on projects, being at the WOMBO office, or some event
      </p>
      <p>
        Add the occasional teenage shenanigans and travels to NYC, SF, and
        Chicago — and I would consider my senior summer a great period
      </p>
      <p>
        I was working, learning, travelling, and had freedom. I was just
        starting to develop deeper relationships with friends and family, gain
        more expertise on productionizing models at scale, and also finally feel
        like I was establishing who am I both to myself and others in tech
      </p>
      <p>
        But change is inevitable, and I was plopped 3 hours away from home in
        the great tri-city of Kitchener-Waterloo
      </p>
      <p>
        While I originally was very excited to get into Waterloo and also attend
        the school, I found that I had developed a lot more agency over the
        summer. Instead of being excited to meet new people and live on my own
        through college, I was worried that I was giving up a lot of the
        momentum I had built for myself over the past couple of months
      </p>
      <p>
        Orientation week was a fun distraction away from that — anyone and
        everyone stepped in my dorm at some point to play 2k or poker — but I
        fell into a rut when classes started
      </p>
      <p>
        I missed my friends abroad that I shared meaningful memories with. I missed
        the feeling of having a hard problem I&#39;d wake up every day to tackle
        at work. I missed the feeling of doing stuff my way. Math and CS courses
        felt super rigid in the way they forced me to think and solve problems.
        I didn&#39;t like school because it felt unfamiliar to what I was doing
        for the past months
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe that&#39;s the point though, maybe the value of education is not
        that it&#39;s supposed to be familiar. Maybe school isn&#39;t supposed
        to teach you the &quot;essential&quot; stuff like doing your taxes. Maybe
        the purpose of school is to expose you to new ideas, while necessarily
        useless, help develop epistemologies that are invaluable to those who
        call themselves lifelong learners
      </p>
      <p>
        I kind of eternalized this through CS 145 While a very difficult course,
        it went over programming concepts I was already familiar with
        (recursion, trees, Big O, RAM, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
        What was unique about it though was re-learning these concepts and
        gaining a new perspective on my intuition. Big O is something we can
        mathematically prove. There are different types of recursion and ways to
        generalize them
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different ways to learn the same concept — only when we
        realize this and retrace our steps do we fill the holes in our knowledge
      </p>
      <p>
        My big brain realization was also attributed to an interview I had done
        this term for the Cansbridge scholarship. My interviewer (shoutout to my
        Persian برادر Ali ) would ask me to explain Stable Diffusion. Then
        explain denoising, Then explain what noise even is. Then explain what a
        Gaussian distribution is
      </p>
      <p>
        He did a real-time depth-first search on what my untapped knowledge was.
        While frustrating at the moment, and I wouldn&#39;t recommend recruiters
        do the same thing, it ended up being a transformative experience
