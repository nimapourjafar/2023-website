      <p>Highlights</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I am helping start an AI lab this summer. We&#39;re called
          <a href="https://twitter.com/omegalabsai">Omega Labs</a>. Grateful to
          be working with great minds like Paul Bridger, Salman Shahid, and
          Parshant Ω
        </li>
        <li>
          I finished CS 146! This course was awesome and dreadful. We learnt
          about creating interpreters, monads, memory models, and a lot of fun
          stuff
        </li>
        <li>I visited Washington for Emergent Ventures Unconference</li>
        <li>我开始学习中文! 中文很有意思</li>
        <li>
          Me and my friends won a hackathon the Milwaukee Bucks ran — we worked
          on creating custom ticket pricing algorithms
        </li>
        <li>
          I have a lot of new thoughts and perspectives on college and work
        </li>
        <li>I read Dune! Very good book. I will be reading Dune Messiah</li>
        <li>Grades are still very good</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Failures</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          This term was one of the worst periods of my life mentally and
          physically. Consisted of a combination of terrible weather, illness,
          and social factors
        </li>
        <li>
          I got to final stage interviews for a lot of companies, clubs,
          scholarships, and other opportunities on-campus, but my efforts
          didn&#39;t really materialize into anything. It was a lot of losing
          while people around me were winning
        </li>
        <li>
          Just a lot of losses, more losses than wins. I was very pessimistic
          day to day. I became a miserable person to be around for a while
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A friend told me I should have more &quot;state-of-mind&quot; updates,
        so I will try to do that this time
      </p>
      <p><strong>Waterloo</strong></p>
      <p>This term was tough, it was very very tough.</p>
      <p>
        To preface, I came into Waterloo with no expectations. I didn&#39;t
        expect to have a big tech job land in my lap, a venture-backed company
        to materialize on a random Saturday, or to do some crazy out-of-world
        magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is because of the mentality I was raised with: &quot;stay modest in
        expectations, but hungry for improvement.&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#39;s a good mentality. It&#39;s the immigrant mentality. It&#39;s
        the mentality that the most important thing is putting your best in
        everyday, and praying life works out. It believes that blood, sweat, and
        tears shed during the weeks, creates generational wealth for the
        decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mentality at Waterloo was not like that. In fact, I&#39;d call it
        pretty much the opposite: &quot;Go big or go home.&quot; It consists of
        joining the shiniest clubs (I had a friend unironically rank which ones
        have the best Linkedin photo), making the &quot;Excited to
        announce...&quot; posts, and min-maxing every aspect of your academic
        and extracurricular life to optimize your resume.
      </p>
      <p>
        This ALSO isn&#39;t a bad mentality. This can speedrun your career, get
        you really nice jobs, give you influence, and all the other juicy
        desires we all love. It is a game you can play, and one that can pay
        off.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a personal thing, but I don&#39;t like that game. Don&#39;t get
        me wrong, both of these processes lead to the same goals: wealth,
        status, and a sense of value — all things that any rational human,
        including me, want.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Waterloo-pysche isn&#39;t something I&#39;m very aligned with. I
        like thinking in 5 or 10 year timelines. I believe that the work,
        friends, travel, and other experiences aren&#39;t things I&#39;m doing
        because I just felt like this. I do them because they will shape who I
        am for life, and guide towards the person I want to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        This connects to thinking for yourself. How Peter Thiel believes the
        best founders aren&#39;t ones that force something in markets or chase
        competition, but ones who create their own unique path, carving out a
        niche where they can thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        It&#39;s very easy to say this, but in practice it&#39;s very hard to
        reinforce this mentality when everyone around you is doing the opposite
        — which is what I really struggled with at school.
      </p>
      <p>It&#39;s hard to explain to people you don&#39;t want to ...</p>
      <ul>
        <li>go to networking events and meet recruiters</li>
        <li>
          work for the Toronto Raptors / Leafs this summer, and do something a
          bit more unconventional (yes, I was offered this job)
        </li>
        <li>prioritize working in San Francisco</li>
        <li>do hackathons</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The way I coped with this during the term were affirmations of
        &quot;Wait until I drop out...&quot; or &quot;This school is a
        scam...&quot;
      </p>
      <p>How could such a negative nelly get anything done in life...</p>
      <p>
        After taking some time to reflect, I found that I was at odds with the
        &quot;high school hacker&quot; archetype I had built up for the past
        couple years. This archetype worked <strong>very well</strong> for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its how I found my footing as an engineer, began establishing myself on
        Twitter, worked for great companies, met amazing life-long friends, made
        me decent money while still young, and got me into the best engineering
        school in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I don&#39;t really want to stick to that archetype. Up until I got
        to college, and I decided I wanted to grow out of it. There was just so
        much more interesting, bigger, and unique work to do. Not even in tech,
        but in terms of fitness, philosophy, and especially math.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a self-conflict with my own values, who I was before, and what
        everyone around me was doing. My &quot;builder&quot; schtick in high
        school worked, but I wasn&#39;t very interested in it anymore. The
        Waterloo game was a loud noise, but I also found it daunting.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I didn&#39;t realize is the point of college is to fix this
        conflict. I wasn&#39;t supposed to hold onto who I used to be and
        complain about how things aren&#39;t going my way. I didn&#39;t go to
        college just to &quot;do my own thing.&quot; If I was that confident in
        &quot;my own thing&quot; I would&#39;ve gone to SF and live my life
        there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came to college to meet the friends that will be lifetime friends,
        learn new things by being exposed by new people, work on dumb things
        with no meaning, to try what is put in front of me and decide if it’s
        cool or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn&#39;t really internalize this lesson until the end of my first
        year, so I&#39;m very much a year behind all my classmates now! But
        it&#39;s all good, and I can appreciate those that are now
        &quot;ahead&quot; of me. I also love competition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Waterloo game is something new, and I won&#39;t grow if I don&#39;t
        try something new. Trying new things isn&#39;t something that aligns
        with the immigrant mentality — but I&#39;ve gotten this far, so sorry
        Mom!
      </p>
      <p>
        But, I can think for myself. The Waterloo game should be a tool for you
        to be what you envision for yourself, not be your end goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I value high impact roles — which to me right now is being a research
        engineer. I want to continue learning about ML || infrastructure ||
        product while being a high agency engineer that smart people can depend
        on. This can only be done by working with the best (PB, Salman,
        Parshant, and Jon Durbin) and being able to think for myself
        (self-studying textbooks and taking initiative at work)
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want the ethos of being a great engineer. This can only be
        achieved through the outputs of my work — projects Omega will be doing
        this summer. Additionally, I need to work somewhere great. Somewhere big
        or elite. I have companies in mind, companies that are interested in me,
        and more in the works. Shoutout to SA...
      </p>
      <p>
        Last but not least, I want to think about the world in my own way. Dune
        was such a great book because there&#39;s no good side, and it really
        forced me to think about what I believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
        All I can say is that I&#39;m excited. I feel a unusual calm sense of
        urgency — but I like it.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Washington</strong></p>
      <p>
        Washington was very fun. I really want to thank MJ and AG for being
        great people to hang out with. Biking around DC, listening to personal
        stories, and just absorbing the natures of Earth and life. I will admit
        that the Unconference had a very diverse cast of people, and it becomes
        very tiring telling a lot of people what you work on. But there are
        always those couple of people that can enable amazing organic
        conversations — which MJ and AG did.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Friends</strong></p>
      <p>
        I&#39;m very happy with my friends at school and in Toronto. I&#39;m
        very happy with my relationship. I&#39;m very happy with my brother. I
        think these have gotten much stronger in the past year. Which is
        invaluable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoutout to <strong>SY</strong> <strong>YK</strong> <strong>ST</strong>
        <strong>SZ</strong> <strong>RF</strong> <strong>ML</strong> and others
        for making my day better whenever I see you guys
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoutout to <strong>PB</strong> and <strong>AM</strong> for being the
        smartest people I know and also letting me practice my broken Farsi with
        them
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoutout to <strong>KC</strong> for being there whenever I win or lose
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoutout to <strong>SS</strong> for being patient with me and taking me
        under his wing this summer
      </p>
      <p>
        Shoutout to 李 老师 — CHINA 101R is the best course I&#39;ve ever done
        in my life, and I will most likely be doing a minor in Chinese while at
        Waterloo
      </p>
      <p><strong>Advice</strong></p>
      <p>
        I&#39;m in no position to give advice. Nonetheless, to make myself feel
        important — here&#39;s what worked and didn&#39;t for me in first year
      </p>
      <p>What worked</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Having previous programming experience and taking CS 145 and CS 146.
          Both of these courses will make you a better programmer and get you
          better marks. Design recipes and writing your own tests are tedious,
          you are also exposed to the smartest students in the school from these
          classes
        </li>
        <li>
          Not fast tracking STAT 230/231 — unless you are a math olympiad, there
          is not rush to get this course done in your first year. Relax
        </li>
        <li>
          Using people I&#39;ve worked with previously to get interviews at
          companies, and building rapports with recruiters for future cycles
        </li>
        <li>
          Doing work for upper years for free, best way to build a rapport is to
          prove you are THAT guy — whether its optimizing model inference or
          sharing my Chinese notes
        </li>
        <li>
          Taking interesting bird courses. Take courses that are interesting and
          easy to study for, don&#39;t take courses that are easy and tedious to
          study for. Examples are language courses, and courses with multiple
          choice exams
        </li>
        <li>
          <a
            href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7136375906146684929/"
            >Trolling on Linkedin</a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          Drinking tea instead of coffee. Tea has no crash and has a much better
          natural taste. Make sure you aren&#39; drinking from tea bags though,
          they have lots of garbage in them. Persian tea and dates would be the
          highlight of my day
        </li>
        <li>
          Being funny. Be funny. You will make someone&#39;s day better, and
          they will appreciate you. You can become friends with people easier.
          Don&#39;t be known as a clown, but have an occasional joke for any
          person are around — this includes interviews
        </li>
        <li>
          Enjoy nature. Nature is beautiful. The geese in Waterloo each have
          their own personality. There will ever only be one first snow in a
          year. Take a moment to appreciate birds coming down to our level
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>What didn&#39;t work</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Comparing yourself to others. You should look up to people, but there
          is no race to be someone you aren&#39;t
        </li>
        <li>
          Neglecting physical health. A chest pump will increase your
          confidence. A leg pump will make you want to get out of your bed
          faster and get on with your day. A back pump will improve your
          posture. Working out has never hurt anyone. No one is judging you when
          you go to PAC, unless you are being a douche.
        </li>
        <li>Being a hater. Everyone is a hater, but hate in moderation.</li>
        <li>
          Eating really disgusting food. Subway everyday can you so far. Go eat
          real food. This means cook, or try to eat stuff off-campus that is
          real-food. Not Lazeez... One of my favorite spots has become Kebab
          Shack — much of the food they make is what I&#39;d have at home
        </li>
        <li>
          Don&#39;t act like you know everything, or what you want to do.
          Don&#39;t say &quot;I want to work in startups&quot; or &quot;I want
          to work in big tech.&quot; There is a gradient of all possible work
          you can do, it isn&#39;t just &quot;startup&quot; or &quot;big
          tech.&quot; There is a range
        </li>
        <li>
          Additionally, don&#39;t limit yourself to an industry you know nothing
          about. Don&#39;t say you want to go into &quot;quant&quot; if you
          aren&#39;t a math olympiad or tried doing some paper trading.
          Don&#39;t say you want to go into &quot;ML&quot; if you haven&#39;t
          tried implementing basic NNs. Only express interest in things
          you&#39;ve tried. Otherwise, try it!
        </li>
      </ul>
